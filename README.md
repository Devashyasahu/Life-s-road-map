# 🌄 Life's Road Map – Mountain Theme (Under Development)

Welcome to the **Life's Road Map** project – a serene, parallax-based web experience built around the metaphor of climbing mountains to represent growth and life journeys.

## 🎨 Features
- Layered mountain landscape with smooth parallax scrolling
- Fog and gradient effects for atmospheric depth
- Responsive layout and clean typography
- Ideal for timelines, life journeys, and personal storytelling

## 🛠 How to Use

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the prototype.
3. All assets (images, fonts, etc.) should be placed inside an `assets` folder (create one if not included).
